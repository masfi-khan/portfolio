  Masfi Khan currently attends Queens High School for the Sciences at York College.
  Despite her school being STEM-centric, Masfi is passionate about writing poetry
  in order to uncover the layers of herself and the ever-changing world.
  She enjoys being founder and editor-in-chief of
  <i> <a href="http://forthesonorous.wixsite.com/forthesonorous/home">For the Sonorous</a>,
</i> a literary journal for women and non-binary people of color.
  This summer, Masfi is thrilled to participate in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program,
  where she exposes herself to computer science and joins a close-knit sisterhood.
  She believes that technology is integral to our society's modernization and that
  women need to have a growing input in its direction.
  She likes singing along off-key to songs, intersectional feminism, and really great books.

  MY CS PORTFOLIO

 <br>
  - After being introduced to both Scratch and Python, I noticed some similarities and differences between them. Like Scratch, Python also
  allows people to include variables, loops, and colors. The largest difference is whit the syntax--Scratch has pre-made building blocks whereas
  Python has guidelines for its code. Though Python is harder to learn, it gives me more control over my projects.
  <br> <br>
  - I was quite surprised and confused when I first started using Python since I had to learn things like
  indenting the code and using different types of punctuation. To help remember the new aspects, I related Python back to Scratch. For example,
  in Scratch, loops are made by repeating things and arrows indicate the instructions, and Python indents those instructions.

  <br>
 - I learned about data structures in python today and yesterday. Since a list contains a set of data, a for-loop can be used to select
   the items from that list and perform a function for them. I found out that there can be lists within lists and that there is
   a format for extracting a specific item from elements using indices. I find it useful because it keeps the data organized and available
   for coding.
 <br> <br>
 - I worked best with my partner Yuki because when we collaborated, I understood the purpose of the function and the way that the
   conditionals and loops operated in it. I also liked sharing our projects with the rest of the class because we discussed the importance
   of including the range of all pixels, since otherwise it can distort the photo. This helped me realize that it's necessary to be
   precise with my inputs and review my work more carefully.
  <br> <br>
 - When creating the filter, a major challenge I faced was that my images kept on becoming distorted. I didn't immediately understand 
   the reason behind it, but after others shared their projects in class, I realized that I did not include a complete range of the 
   intensity levels in my code. I had accidentally omitted one of them. After identifying my error, I gained a clearer idea of being
   more specific in my code and reviewing my work.
   <br> <br>
 - In the filter project, variables, conditionals, loops, and functions are used. We began by defining the function "colorization" 
   creating the colors as variables based on their RGB values and including the color sum as another variable.. We used a for-loop 
   to select pixels from the image list and perform the filter.
   The conditinals stated the guidelines for the color ranges and added the recolored pixels to the recolored list.
   <br> <br>
 - I would create a filter that adds objects to specific places. I think that this could be made by having an image of the object
   and identifying a location in each picture to place it.

  In creating the circuit, I encountered some challenges. The most prominent one included having a non-functioning LED light and digital
  pins. This made it difficult for my group to identify why our circuit was not working. After receiving help from our teachers, we learned
  of this dilemma. When we were forming the parallel circuit, I learned that the jumper wires direct the current flow between the LED lights
  and act as passageways.
