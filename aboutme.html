  Masfi Khan grew up in Queens, New York.
  She currently attends Queens High School for the Sciences at York College.
  Despite her school being STEM-centric, Masfi is passionate about writing poetry
  in order to uncover the layers of herself and the ever-changing world.
  She enjoys being founder and editor-in-chief of
  <body link="gray">
  <i> <a href="http://forthesonorous.wixsite.com/forthesonorous/home">For the Sonorous,</a>
</i>
  a literary journal for women and non-binary people of color.
  This summer, Masfi is thrilled about participating in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program,
  where she exposes herself to computer science and joins a close-knit sisterhood.
  She believes that technology is integral to our society's modernization and that
  women need to have a growing input in its direction.
  She likes singing along off-key to songs, intersectional feminism, and really great books.
