  Masfi Khan currently attends Queens High School for the Sciences at York College.
  Despite her school being STEM-centric, Masfi is passionate about writing poetry
  in order to uncover the layers of herself and the ever-changing world.
  She enjoys being founder and editor-in-chief of
  <i> <a href="http://forthesonorous.wixsite.com/forthesonorous/home">For the Sonorous</a>,
</i> a literary journal for women and non-binary people of color.
  This summer, Masfi is thrilled to participate in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program,
  where she exposes herself to computer science and joins a close-knit sisterhood.
  She believes that technology is integral to our society's modernization and that
  women need to have a growing input in its direction.
  She likes singing along off-key to songs, intersectional feminism, and really great books.

  <i> July 19, 2017 </i>
  - After being introduced to both Scratch and Python, I noticed some similarities and differences between them. Like Scratch, Python also 
  allows people to include variables, loops, and colors. The largest difference is whit the syntax--Scratch has pre-made building blocks whereas
  Python has guidelines for its code. Though Python is harder to learn, it gives me more control over my projects.
  <br>
  - I was quite surprised and confused when I first started using Python since I had to learn things like
  indenting the code and using different types of punctuation. To help remember the new aspects, I related Python back to Scratch. For example,
  in Scratch, loops are made by repeating things and arrows indicate the instructions, and Python indents those instructions.
