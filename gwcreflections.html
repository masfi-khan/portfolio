  After being introduced to both Scratch and Python, I noticed some similarities and differences between them. Like Scratch, Python also
  allows people to include variables, loops, and colors. The largest difference is whit the syntax--Scratch has pre-made building blocks whereas
  Python has guidelines for its code. Though Python is harder to learn, it gives me more control over my projects. I was quite surprised and confused when I first started using Python since I had to learn things like
  indenting the code and using different types of punctuation. To help remember the new aspects, I related Python back to Scratch. For example,
  in Scratch, loops are made by repeating things and arrows indicate the instructions, and Python indents those instructions.

 I learned about data structures in python today and yesterday. Since a list contains a set of data, a for-loop can be used to select
   the items from that list and perform a function for them. I found out that there can be lists within lists and that there is
   a format for extracting a specific item from elements using indices. I find it useful because it keeps the data organized and available
   for coding.
 <br> <br>
 I worked best with my partner Yuki because when we collaborated, I understood the purpose of the function and the way that the
   conditionals and loops operated in it. I also liked sharing our projects with the rest of the class because we discussed the importance
   of including the range of all pixels, since otherwise it can distort the photo. This helped me realize that it's necessary to be
   precise with my inputs and review my work more carefully.
  <br> <br>
 When creating the filter, a major challenge I faced was that my images kept on becoming distorted. I didn't immediately understand
   the reason behind it, but after others shared their projects in class, I realized that I did not include a complete range of the
   intensity levels in my code. I had accidentally omitted one of them. After identifying my error, I gained a clearer idea of being
   more specific in my code and reviewing my work. In the filter project, variables, conditionals, loops, and functions are used. We began by defining the function "colorization"
   creating the colors as variables based on their RGB values and including the color sum as another variable.. We used a for-loop
   to select pixels from the image list and perform the filter.
   The conditinals stated the guidelines for the color ranges and added the recolored pixels to the recolored list.
   I would create a filter that adds objects to specific places. I think that this could be made by having an image of the object
   and identifying a location in each picture to place it.

  In creating the circuit, I encountered some challenges. The most prominent one included having a non-functioning LED light and digital
  pins. This made it difficult for my group to identify why our circuit was not working. After receiving help from our teachers, we learned
  about this dilemma, and we used the other set of digital pins and another LED light. When we were forming the parallel circuit, I learned that the jumper wires direct the current flow between the LED lights
  and act as passageways, so we needed three jumper wires for it. For instance, there were two jumper wires that bordered the LED lights
  and were in the same rows as them.

  Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard conduct work with robots that share similarities. Manuela Veloso uses machine learning for robots
    to make them resemble humans, such as being able to ask for help, and she wants to make it possible for robots to expalin themselves
    in detail through AI. Ayanna Howard co-founded Zyorobotics, which uses robots to help kids with special needs. Both women engineers
    use AI-based robotics that responds to human input.
    <br> <br>
  My team worked together on the lightshow by brainstorming the code, which included functions for the pairs of LED lights and a loop
    for all of the controls. We encountered problems with the robot, since only two of the digital pins worked, and we had trouble
    properly uploading the code to Arduino. Due to these technical difficulties, our LED lightshow didn't perform like how we wanted it to.
    After looking at the projects of the other groups, I noticed that one group had their LED lights randomly blink within a time
    range. They used a for-loop for every LED light, which I think made their code easier to follow and more organized.
   The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch include the void setup and void loop functions. The void setup establishes the inputs or
    outputs of the digital pins, and the void loop repeats actions for the pins.

    I learned that circuits can be created using robots and that the jumper wires direct the flow of electricity between the LED lights.
    My favorite part of the robot's dance was when it did half and full rotations because it matched the chorus of the song "Cold Water."
    When creating the code, it was interesting to play around with the rotation angles and see how the steps transitioned into one another.
    For their robots, Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard need mechanical outputs that reacts to objects.

  One thing I learned about how the Internet works is that data between computers uses routers to direct the information around the Internet.
  Data packets, which contains information about the data, arrives to routers and they read the IP address to send the data packet to its
  destination. I think LaTeX is a markup language since it's used for formatting and determines what a page looks like, rather than
  being more interactive and dealing with what a page does.
  <br> <br>
  During the gallery walk, I liked that others had buttons to change their background colors. I can implement this by including a button
  that call a function which has a different background color. One JavaScript challenge I encountered is getting the button on the homepage
  to signal an alert box. I resolved it by making a new JavaScript file for that code and learning that script tags are for JavaScript
  code in HTML files.
